    "* **Cyclic Behavior**:\n",
    "  1. Cyclic behavior refers to repetitive patterns or fluctuations in data that occur over longer time intervals than seasonality.\n",
    "  2. Cycles are often irregular in duration and amplitude, and they do not have fixed or predictable periods.\n",
    "  3. Cycles typically result from economic, business, or environmental factors that operate over longer time horizons, such as business cycles, economic expansions and contractions, or long-term climate cycles.\n",
    "  4. Unlike seasonality, cyclic behavior does not follow fixed calendar-based patterns and may not exhibit consistent periodicity over time.\n",
    "* **Seasonality**:\n",
    "  1. Seasonality refers to regular, predictable patterns or fluctuations in data that occur at fixed intervals or periods.\n",
    "  2. Seasonal patterns repeat with a consistent frequency or period, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.\n",
    "  3. Seasonality is often influenced by calendar effects, weather patterns, holidays, or other recurring events that occur on a regular basis.\n",
    "  4. Seasonal patterns are typically more uniform and consistent compared to cyclic behavior, with clear peaks and troughs occurring at specific times of the year or other intervals.\n",
    "  4. Seasonality can be decomposed into distinct seasonal components, such as daily, weekly, or monthly effects, which can be modeled and analyzed separately."
